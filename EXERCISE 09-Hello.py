#Exercise 9: Hello

# Define a function that prints "Hello" to the console
def hello():
    print("Hello")  # This prints the string "Hello" when the function is called

# Define the main function to manage the program's flow
def main():
    hello()  # Call the hello() function to print "Hello"

# Ensure the program runs only when executed directly, not when imported
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()  # Call the main() function to start the program
